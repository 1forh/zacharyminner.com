Heyo, I'm Zac. I'm a full stack developer building ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ websites and applications at [SKYCATCHFIRE](https://skycatchfire.com). My awesome coworkers and I have built some really [cool stuff](https://www.skycatchfire.com/portfolio) together. We've built WordPress and Drupal 8 sites, Vue.js, React and React Native applications, tools that help people every day, and websites that show off how awesome the companies are that hire us.

I live with my beautiful fiancÃ© Haley and my kitties Ava, Lily, and BMO. I'm a Zac of all trades and I'm always trying to learn more about myself and everything else.
