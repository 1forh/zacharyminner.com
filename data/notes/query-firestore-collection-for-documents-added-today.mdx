## Caveats

This example assumes that each document in your collection has a date field. I'm also using the [Firebase Admin SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup) as this code is run in a [Firebase Function](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions).

I have a `date` field on each of the documents in my `notes` collection.

## Helper function

In the `getStartOfToday` function below, first we get today's date using `new Date()`. Then we set it to midnight of today, convert it to a timestamp, and return the timestamp.

```jsx
function getStartOfToday() {
  const now = new Date()
  now.setHours(5, 0, 0, 0) // +5 hours for easter standard time
  const timestamp = admin.firestore.Timestamp.fromDate(now)
  return timestamp // ex. 1631246400
}
```

_Note: I had to add 5 hours to get EST. You might want to tweak this and test yourself._ 🤷‍♂️

## Querying the `notes` collection

As you can see below, with the `getStartOfToday` function we can run a Firestore query and ask for all documents that have a timestamp greater than the beginning of today. This will return only the documents that have a timestamp from today assuming your `date` field is of type `Timestamp`. Woot! 🎊

```jsx
const snapshot = await admin
  .firestore()
  .collection('notes')
  .where('date', '>', getStartOfToday())
  .get()
const notes = snapshot.docs.map((doc) => doc.data())
```

## All Together

```jsx
function getStartOfToday() {
  const now = new Date()
  now.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0) // +5 hours for Eastern Time
  const timestamp = admin.firestore.Timestamp.fromDate(now)
  return timestamp
}

const snapshot = await admin
  .firestore()
  .collection('notes')
  .where('date', '>', getStartOfToday())
  .get()
const notes = snapshot.docs.map((doc) => doc.data())
```
