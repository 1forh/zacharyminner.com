First we get today's date using `new Date()`. Then we set it to midnight of today and convert it to a timestamp.

**Note:** I had to add `+5` hours to get midnight in Eastern Time.

```jsx
function getStartOfToday() {
  const now = new Date()
  now.setHours(5, 0, 0, 0) // +5 hours for Eastern Time
  const timestamp = admin.firestore.Timestamp.fromDate(now)
  return timestamp
}
```

As you can see below, with the `getStartOfToday` function we can run a Firestore query and ask for all documents that have a Timestamp greater than the beginning of today. This will return only the documents that have a timestamp from today assuming your `date` field is of type `Timestamp`. Woot! ðŸŽŠ

```jsx
const snapshot = await admin
  .firestore()
  .collection('notes')
  .where('date', '>', getStartOfToday())
  .get()
const notes = snapshot.docs.map((doc) => doc.data())
```

Check out the full snippet below:

```jsx
function getStartOfToday() {
  const now = new Date()
  now.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0) // +5 hours for Eastern Time
  const timestamp = admin.firestore.Timestamp.fromDate(now)
  return timestamp
}

const snapshot = await admin
  .firestore()
  .collection('notes')
  .where('date', '>', getStartOfToday())
  .get()
const notes = snapshot.docs.map((doc) => doc.data())
```
