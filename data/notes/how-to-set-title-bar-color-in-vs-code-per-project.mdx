You can change the background color and text color of VS Code's title bar per project. Create a `.vscode/settings.json` file in the root of your project and add this confirugration:

```json
{
  "workbench.colorCustomizations": {
    "titleBar.activeForeground": "#fff",
    "titleBar.inactiveForeground": "#ffffffcc",
    "titleBar.activeBackground": "#3F758D",
    "titleBar.inactiveBackground": "#3F758DCC"
  }
}
```

You can update the `titleBar.activeBackground` and `titleBar.inactiveBackground` to change the background color to any hex you would like.

Seems cool to add the project's primary color here so you can easily recognize the VS Code window that your project is in. ðŸ˜Ž
