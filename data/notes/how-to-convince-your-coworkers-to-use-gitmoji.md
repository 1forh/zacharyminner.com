## What is Gitmoji?

[Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) is pretty dope. Put simply, it's a standard for using emojis in your commit messages.

Removed a file or a leftover `console.log`? Add a üî• emoji to the beginning of your commit message. Fixed a layout bug in Safari? Add a üêõ emoji. Added some sweet styles for that new Copy with Media component? Add a üíÑ emoji.

So easy. So effective. Another developer can review your pull request and gain a lot of context just by scanning your commit messages before diving deeper.

## The Steps

1.  Start using Gitmoji yourself. Add an emoji to the beginning of each of your commits. You gotta set a good example and use it in every commit. Don't mess this up!
2.  Make sure you send a link to [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) in Slack a few times as a subtle hint to your coworkers.
3.  Say good things about it so your coworkers feel like they're missing out.
4.  Tell newer developers that this is the way to do things where you work. Get them using emojis. Get them on your side. They are easy to influence.
5.  Bribe a coworker. A small bribe can go a long way to nudge the progress forward here. Don't be afraid to buy someone a beer üçª if they'll try out [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/).
6.  Just wait a little bit. Things will fall into place. Be patient.
7.  After a few days, the whole office will be using it. Nice work. üëç
