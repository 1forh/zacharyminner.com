A list of daily reminders for myself

1.  I am of the nature to grow old. There is no way to escape growing old.
2.  I am of the nature to have ill health. There is no way to escape ill health.
3.  I am of the nature to die. There is no way to escape death.
4.  All that is dear to me and everyone I love are of the nature to change. There is no way to escape being separated from them.
5.  My actions are my only true belongings. I cannot escape the consequences of my actions. My actions are the ground upon which I stand.
6.  When speaking to others, or to yourself, think first:
    1. Is it kind?
    2. Is it necessary?
    3. Is it honest?
7.  Don't complain.
8.  Donâ€™t quit anything. If you start it, finish it.
9.  Just do it. Even if you don't want to. Especially if you don't want to.
10. Don't resist uncomfortable situations or thoughts. Welcome those challenges and deal with them right away.
11. Show appreciation and gratitude to the people around you.
12. When you sense an uncomfortable emotion creeping in, clap your hands together and breathe.
13. Your body is a vehicle to help others. Take good care of it.
14. Be kind. Be compassionate. Think of others, always.
15. Smile and enjoy your time here.
16. Don't take things too seriously.
17. If today is your last day on Earth, how will you make the world a better place before you leave?
