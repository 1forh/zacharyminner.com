You can enable element rulers in Chromium browsers. They are dope. Open Inspector and hit Escape to open Settings. Under Elements check “Show rulers”. This dev tool feature is also available in Firefox. Learned that thanks to [this tweet](https://twitter.com/frontstuff_io/status/1407824370945474564)!
