A simple pomodoro timer application that allows a user to keep track of 30 minute intervals. After the 30 minutes has elapsed, a break timer will be displayed for the user to start. Resetting the timer or ending a break will reset the clock back to the 30 minutes to start another cycle.

This was built using [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
