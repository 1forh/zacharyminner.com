This is a [Wolfram Elementary Cellular Automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_cellular_automaton) simulation written in JavaScript.

"_Cellular Automaton_ (CA) is a collection of cells, with states, on a grid of specified shape that evolves through several discrete time steps according to a set of rules based on the states of neighboring cells. The rules are then applied iteratively for as many time steps as desired." [Reference](https://medium.com/cantors-paradise/elementary-cellular-automaton-e27e3d1008d9)

The user is able to select how many generations the simulation will run for and which ruleset to follow from a pre-established set of rulesets.
