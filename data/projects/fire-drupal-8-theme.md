## Introduction

Fire is a custom Drupal 8 starter theme that we use at [SKYCATCHFIRE](https://www.skycatchfire.com/) as a base for all our new Drupal 8 websites and web applications.

https://github.com/skycatchfire/fire-drupal

The Fire starter theme utilizes [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to compile and minify JavaScript and CSS. We use [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) as our CSS framework because utility classes are cool. ðŸ˜Ž
