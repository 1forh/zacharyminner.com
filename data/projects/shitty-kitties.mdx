[My girlfriend Haley](/about) and I have released our second NFT collection on the Algorand blockchain, Shitty Kitties. It's a fun collection containing 470 1/1 unique shitty drawings resembling a kitty 🐈🤷‍♂️.

Each of the Shitty Kitties is a hand-drawn "work of art" consisting of a randomized background, fur, clothing, head-dressing, and accessory.

We named the collection Shitty Kitties because it's funny and the drawings are not good but they are pretty dang adorable, let's be honest.
