summary: Keep a straight face or drink!
---

Keep a straight face or drink! The point of the game is to try and keep a straight face even when you've been drinking and having a good time.

Sit in a circle and take turns reading cards out loud. Anyone who can't keep a straight face, drinks! You can make it a little easier by tweaking the rules: if anyone laughs out loud, drink!

Best played on mobile device. Have fun!
