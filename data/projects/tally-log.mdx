> From fitness goals to curbing bad habits to whatever else you can think of, Tally Log can help you keep a tally.

I built the web app first (which you can view at https://tallylog.com/) and then built the iOS version to help me learn React Native.

I probably should explain more about what the app does and how I built it now but feeling pretty lazy so here are some screenshots at least. Might do a write-up later but not making any promises.

<div className="grid grid-cols-2 gap-2">
