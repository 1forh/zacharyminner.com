This game was also built following along with the[The Ultimate Guide to Game Development with Unity 2019](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-guide-to-game-development-with-unity/) course on Udemy. It is the second game that you work on in the course.

It is very barebones and was meant to showcase the different beginner techniques used in making platformer games.
