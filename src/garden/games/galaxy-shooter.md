This game was built following along with the [The Ultimate Guide to Game Development with Unity 2019](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-guide-to-game-development-with-unity/) course on Udemy. It is the first game that you make in the course.

The player has three lives to destroy as many enemy ships as possible. Three power-ups spawn at random intervals throughout the game. The power-ups include a triple-shot power-up, a speed power-up, and a shield power-up.
