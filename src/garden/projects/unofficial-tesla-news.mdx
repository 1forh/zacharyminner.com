Unofficial Tesla News was built at [SKYCATCHFIRE](https://skycatchfire.com) to aggregate articles and videos from the most popular websites and YouTube channels. It provides an easy way to view the very latest Tesla news and videos. It also provides a feed of Elon Musk's tweets.

Various websites are scraped every minute and using Angular and Firebase, the three feeds (articles, videos, tweets) are automatically updated as new content is published. The application also provides a small stock ticker for TSLA and allows the user to choose between a light and dark color theme.
