Tally Mark Tracker allows users to create whatever items they want to track and drag and drop the items to sort them.

Tally Mark Tracker utilizes [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/configuration), [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/), and [vuex-persistedstate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuex-persistedstate). vuex-persistedstate saves the Vuex store in local storage so the user doesn't lose any tally marks they've tracked when the page is refreshed.
